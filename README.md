GitamFeed

This is the code which powers the Gitam Feed app on Android by JateDevelopers.

GITAM feed is the go-to-app for all the gitamite's scouting for great news about our sublime campus.

This app includes all the spot-on information about the contemporary and upcoming events/fests being organized at our prestigious institution. This app also includes all materials required by the students.

This app is meant for a simple yet powerful rich text experience. It's still being built and improved.
